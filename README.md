# UG-Project

Made for requirement for BTech project in my college at Indian Institute of Technology BHU Varanasi.
- This project explores an innovative machine learning (ML) technique designed to optimize fleet management by reducing operational expenses.
- It achieves this by minimizing the queuing time of trucks and the idle time of excavators through intelligent fleet selection. This method draws inspiration from Nobahar's research and was implemented at the Zenouz kaolin mine to optimize loader types and the number of trucks necessary to supply ore to the processing plant. \
- The study utilized five years of data, including dates, weather conditions, truck numbers, routes, loader types, and daily hauled ore.
